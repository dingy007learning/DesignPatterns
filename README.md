# DesignPatterns
**NOTES**

1.  To avoid if-else structures/switch cases, use either the State-pattern (Policy pattern) or Strategy pattern (both are behavioral patterns)

*   Use Strategy pattern, when having to choose between algorithms or actual implementations
*   Use State pattern, when having to change the behavior of the object based on its state
