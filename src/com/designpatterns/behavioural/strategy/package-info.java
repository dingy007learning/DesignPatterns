/**
 * Strategy pattern can be used to replace if/else or switch-case statements. It allows the object to be delegated during runtime to serve the purpose.
 * In this example (from 'experience-design-patterns' Udemy), the 'nextStepCalculation' can be done by, either 'easy', 'medium' or 'hard' algorithm.
 * This can be implemented using a switch-case, but here we are using Strategy pattern to delegate the object dynamically.
